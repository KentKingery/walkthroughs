# Simple Walkthroughs
## Purpose

When I start learning any new technology, I always create a basic walkthrough to exercise my understanding of it. For example, when I first started learning Go, I created a number of walkthroughs to do certain things (e.g. read a file, expose a REST API, etc.). I have found this process to be invaluable in helping me gain a better (and quicker) understanding of the topic.

While I have benefitted from numerous other similar approaches over the years, I have found that recently these types of tutorials or walkthroughs often make a lot of assumptions. I'm reminded of an old joke I heard when first starting to learn card and coin magic (yes, I am one of those hobbyist magicians). One of my mentors would always say "And here, you can vanish the elephant using your favorite method".

My goal with these walkthroughs is to start literally at ground zero (well, almost). I will assume nothing other than that you have a computer, can install things on it (reasonably easily), and are interested in understanding everything from the ground up.

## Languages

I write code in a lot of different languages. Those languages are sometimes the subject themselves of the walkthrough. I have tried to stick to a standard hierarchy here where the intent is to have the topics at a high level (e.g. Jaeger) and then language-specific versions of the walkthrough below that.

In some (many?) cases, there will only be one language represented, but most of the languages I use are at least understandable by a competent programmer. As I get more ambitious (and have time), I'll add languages to those topics where they don't exist. Jaeger is a great example. Initially, it will just be Go, but I'll soon flesh it out to have C#, Java, and Python versions of the walkthrough.

This polyglot approach is as much for me as it is for you, dear reader. I frequently like to do comparisons of how things work in languages, and I've found that writing the same functional example in multiple languages is the best way to learn.
