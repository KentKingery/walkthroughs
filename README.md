# Simple Walkthroughs
## Purpose
When I start learning any new technology, I always create a basic walkthrough to exercise my understanding of it. For example, when I first started learning Go, I created a number of walkthroughs to do certain things (e.g. read a file, expose a REST API, etc.). I have found this process to be invaluable in helping me gain a better (and quicker) understanding of the topic.

While I have benefitted from numerous other similar approaches over the years, I have found that recently these types of tutorials or walkthroughs often make a lot of assumptions. I'm reminded of an old joke I heard when first starting to learn card and coin magic (yes, I am one of those hobbyist magicians). One of my mentors would always say "And here, you can vanish the elephant using your favorite method".

My goal with these walkthroughs is to start literally at ground zero (well, almost). I will assume nothing other than that you have a computer, can install things on it (reasonably easily), and are interested in understanding everything from the ground up.
